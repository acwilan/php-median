# php-median

Small script that tests and benchmarks two different implementations
of median calculation over an array. The first one is using a class
which in turn uses heap strategy to calculate median of a given array,
and the second one is using a plain function.

It includes a PHP script to run the test suite, just type `php median_test.php` to see results in console.
